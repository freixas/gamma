<p>There are two things you should know about Gamma:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You don't create diagrams with the user interface—you write scripts.</li>
  <li>Gamma doesn't have an editor—you edit the scripts in your favorite text editor.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Scripts</h1>
<p>I know. You wanted to try out the program—you didn't want to have to learn a new programming language!</p>
<p>But you're  smart or you wouldn't be here. Go to the <strong>Help</strong> menu and check out the sample scripts. You can probably figure out how things work just by looking at some examples. Then check out the help content which includes some quick start tips. </p>
<p>There is a detailed manual if you need it.</p>
<h1>Editing</h1>
<p>Before you get too far, go to <strong>File / Preferences</strong> and look at the editor command. It should be set to a operatng-system-specific editor. Even though Gamma has no editor, when you select a script file, it executes the editor command (replacing &quot;$F$&quot; with the name of the file). You don't have to use the editor command; you can delete it and just open the editor yourself.</p>
<p>Once you point Gamma to a text file, it will update the diagram automatically each time you save it. So, try something, save the file, and see what happens.</p>
<h1>Problems?</h1>
<p>This is an alpha release, so I'm sure there are still bugs. If you find one or have any questions, write to me at:</p>
